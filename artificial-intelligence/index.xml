      <title>The Min-Max Algorithm in Java</title>

      <description>In order to understand the min-max algorithm, you should get familiar with game playing and game trees. Game playing can be classified as game trees. What is a game tree? A tree is made of a root node, and a root node has child nodes; each child node is subdivided into multiple children.
This forms a tree, and the terminal nodes are termed leaves, as shown in the following diagram:</description>

      <title>Breadth First Search Algorithm Tutorial with Java</title>
      <link>http://example.org/artificial-intelligence/breadth-first-search-java/</link>

      <description>This lesson is part of the course: Artificial Intelligence
 Uninformed Search vs Informed / Heuristic Search The next couple of algorithms we will be covering in this Artificial Intelligence course can be classed as either:
uninformed or blind searches: in which our algorithms have no additional information about states beyond that provided in the problem definition.
Informed or Heuristic searches: in which our algorithms have some extra knowledge about the problem domain and can distinguish whether or not one non-goal state is “more promising” than another.</description>

      <title>Depth First Search in Java</title>
      <link>http://example.org/artificial-intelligence/depth-first-search/</link>

      <description>Depth First Search DFS is another uninformed graph traversal algorithm which produces a non-optimal solution but can be useful for traversing quickly into deeper search domains. Depth first search is very similar to the previously covered breadth first search that we covered in this tutorial: breadth first search in Java
How it Works With Depth first search you start at the top most node in a tree and then follow the left most branch until there exists no more leafs in that branch.</description>

      <title>Depth Limited Search in Java</title>
      <link>http://example.org/artificial-intelligence/depth-limited-search-in-java/</link>

      <description>About Depth Limited Searching Traditional depth first search could be deemed useless in infinite state spaces as they will continue to traverse down the leftmost branch infinitely. This essentially means that the path to the goal node might never be found, in order to combat this we can add a limit to the depth that our search recurses down the tree, this essentially transforms our depth first algorithm into a depth-limited algorithm.</description>

      <title>An Introduction To Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>This is lesson one of the Artificial Intelligence course on this website. What is Artificial Intelligence? Artificial Intelligence is a huge field of computer science that is focused primarily on building agents that think and perform actions independant from human interference. If you are or have ever been a gamer then you will have experienced artificial intelligence in action contained within the non-player characters that try to prevent you from winning the games.</description>

      <title>What Is An Intelligent Agent</title>

      <description>In Artificial Intelligence, Intelligent agents are the decision makers. They perceive their environment through a series of sensors and act upon this information using actuators.
A simple example of this is a robot hoover. Through a series of sensors, it can sense whether or not the floor is dirty and based off this information it will then decide whether or not to continue cleaning the floor.
Intelligent Agents In Industry Finance An example of a useful intelligent agent in the finance industry would be something that perceives the stock environment and then acts on this information in order to make trades and generate profit.</description>
