      <title>Using RwLock and CondVars in Rust</title>

      <description>Read many, write exclusive locks – RwLock Consider a situation where you have a resource that must be manipulated only a single thread at a time, but is safe to be queried by many—that is, you have many readers and only one writer.
While you could protect this resource with a mutex, the trouble is that the mutex makes no distinction between its lockers; every thread will be forced to wait, no matter what their intentions.</description>

      <title>Learning Generics in Rust</title>
      <link>http://example.org/rust/learning-generics-in-rust/</link>

      <description>Generics are a facility to write code for multiple contexts with different types, and parameterization allows the programmer to write code that makes fewer assumptions about the data structures and code segments involved in the code&amp;rsquo;s definition.
For example, a very ambiguous concept would be the concept of addition. When a programmer writes a + b, what does that mean? In Rust, the Add trait can be implemented for just about any type.</description>

      <title>Scope and Ownership in Rust</title>
      <link>http://example.org/rust/scope-ownership-in-rust/</link>

      <description>In Rust, every data value has a single owning scope—no more, no less. So, what&amp;rsquo;s a scope? The easy answer is that a scope is the place where a block expression stores its variables. Scopes are not directly represented in the source code, but a scope begins when a block expression begins, with a { symbol, and ends when the block expression ends, with } (or when a return statement is run before the block reaches its end).</description>

      <title>Working with JSON in Rust - Tutorial</title>
      <link>http://example.org/rust/rust-working-with-json-tutorial/</link>

      <guid>http://example.org/rust/rust-working-with-json-tutorial/</guid>
      <description>This tutorial was built using Rust Version: 1.22.1
 Introduction Most programming languages support JSON as part of the core language by default. It&amp;rsquo;s an incredibly popular data format that is used in millions of different applications.
In this tutorial we&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at how you can effectively work with JSON objects within our own Rust based systems. In order to do this we&amp;rsquo;ll be creating a very simple REST API that will do a variety of different things with JSON objects.</description>

      <description>In this article we will be looking at the best books you can buy to help you learn the basics of Rust Systems Development.
Rust is an incredibly fast systems programming language that is used by a very wide range of organizations such as mozilla (the original creators of the language), Atlassion, Dropbox and npm.
Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development (1st Edition) is a fantastic resource for those of you willing to pick up the relatively new language.</description>
