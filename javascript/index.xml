      <description>In this tutorial, we are going to have a look at how you can make your JavaScript programs more syntactically beautiful with the use of both the async and await keywords. Both of these keywords were introduced into Node in version 7.6. Hopefully, by the end of the tutorial, you will be going back to refactor all of your old NodeJS based applications to replace all of your chained callbacks and promises.</description>

      <title>Retrieving Website Visitor Information Using Javascript</title>

      <description>In this tutorial I&#39;ll be demonstrating how you can retrieve key information about all your website visitors using a very simple javascript snippet. This could in theory be placed on all your website&#39;s pages and then returned to a REST API which then stores this information for you to analyse in the future. I thought this would be an interesting little snippet for those of you thinking of rolling your own google analytics-like tracking.</description>
