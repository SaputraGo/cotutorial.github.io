      <description>Recently, I’ve started studying for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer certificate, CKAD for short, and I thought I would share some of the notes I took in an effort to try and pass this certification. This won’t be a comprehensive view of Kubernetes, but it should give anyone reading it a solid-enough grounding to base their own studies off of. If you find any mistakes here, LET ME KNOW ASAP, as I’m hoping to sit the test in the coming few weeks!</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve frequented this site in the past you should hopefully have noticed a huge change to the way the site looks and hopefully the speed at which the site serves content. Over the past 2 weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with a static site tool, similar to that of Jekyll, called Hugo.
Reasons for the Migration Ease The first and biggest reason I&amp;rsquo;m moving to a github based site is due to the ease with which I can make changes.</description>
